          <span className="undelineMe">Service performance score:</span> The
          percentage of measured mailpieces within each product or product
          component that met their applicable service standard.

        <li>
          <span className="undelineMe">Service performance target:</span> A goal
          set by the Postal Service for the percentage of measured mailpieces
          within a particular product or product component to be delivered
          within their applicable service standard.

          <span className="undelineMe">Product:</span>
          “[A] postal service with a distinct cost or market characteristic for
          which a rate or rates are, or may reasonably be, applied.” 39 U.S.C. §
          102(6). Each Market Dominant class consists of multiple products.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span className="undelineMe"> Product component:</span> A term created
          for purposes of this dashboard only to refer to reporting by the
          Postal Service below the product level. For most products, USPS sets
          aggregate service performance targets, i.e., the percentage of all
          measured mailpieces within that product that should meet their
          applicable service standard, whatever that service standard happened
          to be. Within First-Class Mail, however, data for certain products are
          reported broken out by individual service standard. For example, for
          the Flats product within First-Class Mail in FY 2019 and FY 2020, the
          Postal Service set three separate service standards with applicable
          on-time percent targets: (1) First-Class Mail Flats Overnight, (2)
          First-Class Mail Flats 2-Day, and (3) First-Class Mail Flats 3-5-Day.
          These are three distinct product components. For any visualization
          that includes mailpieces within First-Class Mail (including
          comparisons of First-Class Mail with other mail classes), the
          disaggregated reporting levels are referred to as “product
          components.”
        </li>

        <li>
          <span className="undelineMe">Market Dominant product:</span> A product
          “in the sale of which the Postal Service exercises sufficient market
          power that it can effectively set the price of such product
          substantially above costs, raise prices significantly, decrease
          quality, or decrease output, without risk of losing a significant
          level of business to other firms offering similar products.” See 39
          U.S.C. § 3642(b)(1). Any product not classified as “Market Dominant”
          is classified as “Competitive.” Id. his dashboard pertains only to
          Market Dominant products and does not contain information on any
          Competitive products’ service performance.
